Preprocessing may include applying filtering functions, removing corrupted or noisy data, and other operations to clean the dataset. The processed results are then saved for further analysis.

Modeling can involve several approaches:
Mathematical modeling, which focuses on analytical or functional computation using mathematical formulas;
Machine learning modeling, which applies classical algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests;
Deep learning modeling, which employs neural network architectures such as MLP, CNN, MAMBA, or Transformer models.

Visualization plays an important role as well. It may include:
Plotting signal data to demonstrate the effects of preprocessing;
Visualizing the distribution of results (for instance, performance metrics for different categories);
Comparing outcomes under different conditions or model configurations to highlight differences in performance.
